Utilities.R
    'load.data'           load data
    'create.lag.value'    create lags for pm2.5 or baseline or wildfire contribution 
    'trans.coef'          exponential transform the coefficients in Poisson model 
        
Model.R
    'model' regression on pm2.5 values; 
        works for sinple or multiple lags
        w/ or w/o mobility data

### moddat_Feb2021.csv
pm25_history  the median average of PM2.5 during 2016-2019
pm25_raw      the PM2.5 for 2020 without filling missing 
pm25          the missing values in pm25_raw been filled using pm25_history
wildfire      the boolean index of wildfire days, according to the smoke phenomenon (hazardmap)
pm_wildfire   the wildfire contributed PM2.5, estimtated as (pm25 - pm25_history) during wildfire days; in non-wildfire days, the value is 0.
pm_ambient    the background PM2.5 (pm25 = pm_wildfire + pm_ambient)
